# Codebase for "Secure sparse matrix multiplications and their applications to PPML"

The goal of this codebase is to implement the experiments mentionned in the paper. **It is not a secure sparse linear algebra package**. Extra effort would be required to implement these algorithms in MPC libraries such as MPyC. Hence, our codebase only contains simplify classes to demonstrate algorithms and do not cover all possible operations (e.g., transpose) on sparse data structures.
